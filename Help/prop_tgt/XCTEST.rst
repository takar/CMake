XCTEST
------

This target is a XCTest CFBundle on the Mac.

This property will usually get set via the ``add_xctest`` macro in
:module:`FindXCTest` module.

If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a CFBundle when built on the Mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a CFBundle.

This property depends on :prop_tgt:`BUNDLE` to be effective.
